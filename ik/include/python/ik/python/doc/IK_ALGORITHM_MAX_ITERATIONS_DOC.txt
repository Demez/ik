How many times to iterate  the  algorithm.
 
FABRIK converges extremely quickly, you can sometimes  get  away with just 3-5
iterations. MSS takes longer  to  converge, approximately 100-1000 iterations.
ONE_BONE and TWO_BONE solvers ignore both of these values since they calculate
the result directly.
